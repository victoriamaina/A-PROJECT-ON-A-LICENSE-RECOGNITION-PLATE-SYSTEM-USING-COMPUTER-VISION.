# A-PROJECT-ON-A-LICENSE-RECOGNITION-PLATE-SYSTEM-USING-COMPUTER-VISION.

By Victoria Maina 

## Description

A repository containing a model used to recognise and classify number plates.

## Business Problem

With increased number of vehicles , there has been an increase in numbers of hit and run , stolen vehicles and vehicles exceeding a certain speed.Tracking of individual vehicle becomes a very challenging task with the massive growth in the vehicular sector every day.Thus a need to create a model that will be used to recognize and classify number plates .


## Objectives

To create a model that will be used to recognize and classify number plates

## Dataset

The data used can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1H6w_d87Jd1c7WwMxMeN6rLZX-ZEOEtY1

## Recording the Experimental Design.

The project will be undertaken through the following procedure;

Setup/Installation Requirements Use Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook for data preparation and analysis.

Image Annotation

Import tensorflow libraries for data manipulation

Loading Data and previewing datasets

Base modelling (CNN)

Image Augmentation

Challenging the Model with Keras Transfer Learning (RESNET50)

Conclusion

Recommendations.


Known Bugs
